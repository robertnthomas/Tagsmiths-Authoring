DITA for Authors Licensing Terms

The DITA for Authors project is an open source project initially
created by and donated by Tagsmiths, LLC. Its intent is to foster the
widest possible use and adoption of DITA. To that end its licensing
terms are as unrestrictive as possible and appropriate.

All DITA for Authors materials are licensed with the same Apache
license as used by the DITA Open Toolkit or with a compatible but
less restrictive license. Sample materials are either in the public
domain or are licensed with some form of Creative Commons license.

The general intent for the DITA for Authors projects is that all the
materials may be used as the base for commercial or non-commercial
derivative works as long as an apppropriate attribution is included
in any use.

In particular, the following uses are explicitly allowed:

+ The DITA for Authors Open Toolkit plugin may be bundled with
  third-party tools and commercial products, either separately or as
  part of a larger Open Toolkit package.

+ The non-Toolkit materials may be used in commercial and
  non-commerical products as allowed by the Apache license (which
  allows essentially unrestricted use with attribution).

+ The sample materials may be used without restriction except where
  they carry a restrictive license as required by the original source.

Attribution for this plugin must be maintained. To do so, preserve
this license.txt file or rename it as license.orignal.txt
